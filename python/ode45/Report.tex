\section{Goal}

To model cloud droplet growth in an updraught.  Droplets are nucleated by a lognormal size distribution of dry aerosols.  Their growth and evolution is observed. ie their individual growth profiles, how those smaller than a certain size don't grow and how that varies with saturation, and how the size distribution varies.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{buoyancy}

Buoyant convection leads to the formation of cumulous clouds.  A parcel of dry air, less dense that its surroundings will have an associated buoyancy force (vertical aceleration).\\

$\frac{d^{2}z}{dt^{2}} = gB, B = \frac{\rho^{'} - \rho}{rho} = \frac{T - T^{'}}{T^{'}}, ' denotes \ surroundings$\\

The upward motion will further be influenced by water loading, friction and mixing with different air.  For moist air virtual temperature is used\\.  

$T_{v} \approx T[1 + 0.6w], w  = \frac{M_{v}}{M_{d}}$\\

There's also a version which takes liquid water into account.\\  

We ignore the other influencing factors mentioned above, so assume no mixing occurs and the parcel follows a pseudoadiabat{\bf verify with Phil about the inherent assumption that liquid falls out of the parcel mentioned in Rogers and Yau}.  As the parcel rises due to buoyancy it adjusts to the surrounding pressure, so it's temperature will change.  Thus saturation water mixing ratio will change leading to supersaturation and condensation (assuming an already saturated parcel, and from a macroscopic perspective).  A simple and macroscale persective is to say that once saturation is reached, condensation occurs such that the water vapour mixing ration does not exceed the saturation value.  It is also possible to view condensation from the perspective of droplet formation.

\subsection{Rate of change of Temperature with Time} 

If we assume pseudoadiabatic lifting of a saturated parcel (which isn't strictly adhered to once supersaturation is allowed), the equivalent potential temperature:\\

$\theta_{e} = T \times (\frac{P_{0}}{P_{d}})^{\frac{R_{d}}{C_{p}}}\times exp(\frac{L_{v}w_{sat}}{C_{p}T})$\\

is conserved with respect to time, so $\frac{d \theta_{e}}{dt} = $\\

$\frac{dT}{dt}(\frac{P_{0}}{P_{d}})^{\frac{R_{d}}{C_{p}}}  - \frac{R_{d}T}{C_{p}}(\frac{P_{0}}{P_{d}})^{\frac{R_{d}}{C_{p}}}\frac{1}{P_{d}}\frac{dP_{d}}{dt} + \frac{d}{dt} (\frac{L_{v}w_{s}}{C_{p}T}) \times T(\frac{P_{0}}{P_{d}})^{\frac{R_{d}}{C_{p}}} = 0$\\

$\frac{dT}{dt}  - \frac{R_{d}T}{C_{p}}\frac{1}{P_{d}}\frac{dP_{d}}{dt} - \frac{L_{v}w_{s}}{C_{p}T}\frac{dT}{dt} + \frac{L_{v}}{C_{p}}\frac{dT}{dt}\frac{dw_{s}}{dT}+ \frac{L_{v}}{C_{p}}\frac{dw_{s}}{dP_{d}}\frac{dP_{d}}{dt} = 0$\\

$\frac{dT}{dt}(1 - \frac{L_{v}w_{s}}{C_{p}T} + \frac{L_{v}}{C_{p}}\frac{dw_{s}}{dT}) = (\frac{R_{d}T}{C_{p}P_{d}} - \frac{L_{v}}{C_{p}}\frac{dw_{s}}{dP})\frac{dP_{d}}{dt} = 0$\\

Assuming hydrostatic balance\\

$\frac{dT}{dt} = (\frac{R_{d}T}{C_{p}P_{d}} - \frac{L_{v}}{C_{p}}\frac{dw_{s}}{dP})(1 - \frac{L_{v}w_{s}}{C_{p}T} + \frac{L_{v}}{C_{p}}\frac{dw_{s}}{dT})^{-1} \times w \times (-\rho g)$\\

Using the Calusius-Claperon equation\\

$\frac{dw_{s}}{dT} = (w_{s} + w_{s}^{2})\frac{1}{e_{s}}\frac{de_{s}}{dT}, \frac{de_{s}}{dT} = \frac{L_{v} e_{s}}{R_{v}T^{2}}, \frac{dw_{s}}{dP} = -\frac{\epsilon \times e_{s}}{(P - e_{s})^{2}}$ \\

\subsection{Cloud Droplet Nucleation}

A system with liquid and vapour, by definition is at saturation when the rates of evapouration and condensation are equal.  This does occur for example over a large mass of water.  For air borne pure water vapour to condense in droplets, a significant free energy barrier must be overcome.  Molecules must collide and agreggate.  Surface tension dictates that a droplet will be sperical, and must be overcome to expand its surface. \\

$dW_{s} = \sigma dA $ \\

So energy is consumed by surface tension and released in the form of the latent heat of condensation.  Also growth is dependent on the surrounding vapor pressure, ie the number of water molecules impinging on its surface.  Evaporation then depends on whether the molecules in the droplet have enough energy to overcome the intermolecular bonds.  \\

Equilibrium is reached when the vapor pressure next to the surface of the droplet is saturated. The saturation vapour pressure for the droplet is obtained from that over bulk water:\\

 $e_{s}(r) = e_{s}(\infty) exp(\frac{2 \sigma}{r R_{v}rho_{L} T})$ \\

 The overall growth so is related (proportional to) to the difference between the ambient vapor pressure and the saturation vapor pressure of the droplet. \\

$e - e_{s}(r)$ \\

When this is positive (ie an available excess of water molecules) the droplet will tend to grow.  The critical radius \\

$\frac{2\sigma}{R_{v}\rho_{L}T ln(\frac{e_{s}(r)}{e_{s}(\infty)})}$ \\

of the droplet is obtained by setting this term equal to zero.  The droplet must attain this value before it is stable. 
\\

 The presence of hydroscopic aerosols greatly increase rates of droplet formation.  The equilibrium vapour pressure of over a plane surface of non-volatile aerosol dissolved in water will be lower per raoult's law \\

$\frac{e^{'}_{s}}{e_{s}(\infty)} = \frac{n_{0}}{n + n_{0}}\ n_{0} = 1 - \frac{n}{n_{0}} number \ of \ water \ molecules, n \ = \ number \ of \ dissolved \ solute \ molecules$\\

 Note that $n$  is $i$ or the Van't Hoff factor multiplied by the number of dry aerosol molecules. So \\

$n = iN_{A}\frac{m_{s}}{M_{s}}, n_{0} = \frac{N_{0}m_{w}}{M_{w}}, m_{w} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3} \rho_{L}$ \\

and \\

$\frac{e^{'}_{s}(r)}{e_{s}(\infty)} = [1 - \frac{b}{r^{3}}]e^{\frac{a}{r}}, a = \frac{2 \sigma}{r R_{v} \rho_{L}T}, b = \frac{3iM_{v} m_{s}}{4 \pi \rho_{L} M_{s}}$ \\

 Using the first order taylor series approximation for the exponential term, and ignoring the product of the two small terms gives \\

$\frac{e^{'}_{s}(r)}{e_{s}(\infty)} = 1 + \frac{a}{r} - \frac{b}{r^{3}}$ \\

 (need to have plot or something for kholer curve.  Note that my script assumes $e^{'}_{s}(r) = e(\infty)$  ) The maximimum on the resulting curve represents the critical radius and value  of \\

$\frac{e^{'}_{s}(r)}{e_{s}(\infty)}$, $r^{*} = \sqrt{\frac{3b}{a}}, S^{*} = 1 + \sqrt{\frac{4a^{3}}{27b}}$\\

\subsection{Diffusional Droplet Growth}

The droplet grows by diffusion of water to its surface.  Consider a droplet with a number of water molecules a distance $R$ from its centre, $n(R)$.  Assume isotropy (uniformaty in all directions) and steady state so \\

$\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} = D \nabla^{2} n = 0$  \\

Converting to spherical coordinates, where only change in the radial direction is considered \\

$\nabla^{2}n(R) = \frac{1}{R^{2}}\frac{\partial}{\partial R} \left( R^{2} \frac{\partial n}{\partial R} \right) = 0$ \\

Solving yields: \\

$n(R) = C_{1} - \frac{C_{2}}{R}$ where $R \rightarrow \infty, n \rightarrow n_{\infty}$ and $R \rightarrow r, n \rightarrow n_{r}$ \\

Using these boundary conditions gives \\

$n(R) = n_{\infty} - \frac{r}{R}(n_{\infty} - n_{r})$ \\

Now the flux of molecules at the surface of the droplet is $D \left( \frac{\partial n}{\partial R} \right)_{R = r}$. So using the differential of $n(R)$  at $R = r$ the rate of mass increase (using density instead of number of molecules):\\

 $\frac{dm}{dt} = 4 \pi r D (\rho_{\infty} - \rho_{r})$.  \\

Substition of $m = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$ into the right hand side yields \\

$\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{D\rho_{v}(\infty)}{r\rho_{l}e(\infty)}[e(\infty) - e(r)]$ 
  
\subsection{Feedback - droplet formation reduces vapour pressure}

$w_{v} = \frac{\epsilon e}{p - e} \approx (1 + SS) \frac{\epsilon e_{s}}{p}$\\

$\frac{dw_{v}}{dt} = (1 + SS) \frac{\epsilon}{p}(\frac{de_{s}}{dT} \frac{dT}{dt}  - \frac{e_{s}}{p} (-g_{0}\rho w) ) + \frac{\epsilon e_{s}}{p} \frac{dSS}{dt}$\\

So\\

$\frac{dSS}{dt} = [\frac{dw_{v}}{dt} - (1 + SS) \frac{\epsilon}{p} (\frac{de_{s}}{dt}\frac{dT}{dt} - \frac{e_{s}}{p}(-g_{0}\rho w))]\frac{p}{\epsilon e_{s}}$

$\frac{dw_{v}}{dt} = -\frac{dw_{l}}{dt} = -\frac{d}{dt} (N_{aero} \frac{4 \pi}{3}r^{3})  = N_{aero} \frac4 \pi r^{2}$\\

\subsection{Aerosol Distributions}

Without the presence of hygroscopic (water loving) aerosol droplets would not form.  Aerosols are formed in a multitude of ways: as of a 1972 study about 20 percent from wind generated dust, 40 percent from sea spray, 10 percent from forest fires, 5 percent from industry (combustion etc), 25 percent from conversion of atmospheric gasses.  They are formed and then undergo transformations; coagularion, condensation, scavenging, washout, sedimentation, dispersion and mixing   For convenience they are regarded as being spherical and are characterized by their effective diameter and are broadly categorized as Aiiken (small: smaller than .2 microns), large (.2 - 2 microns) and giant (larger than 2 microns).\\

Measurement of the concentration of cloud nucleating aerosols was first carried out using an Aitken couter.  This instrument expands a sample of humidified air such that it becomes supersaturated (100percent so much more than in the lower troposphere).  Condensed water droplets are counted.  Aerosol size is measured by charging the aerosols and measuring their mobility ie their ability to reach a detector against an electric field.\\

Concentration of cloud nucleating aerosols will vary in space and time but in general is highest near the surface.\\

Say the number of aerosol of a particular diameter $D^{'}$ is $n_{d}(D)$ then the number with diameters less than $D$ is $N(D)=\int^{D}_{0}n_{d}(D^{'})dD$ and $n_{d}(D') = \frac{dN}{dD^{'}}$  or $n_{d}(D')dD^{'}$ is the number per $cm^{3}$ in the binwith $dD^{'}$ Since aerosols vary over a wide scale the logarithmic scale is used. So $n_{d}(D) = \frac{dN(D)}{d(lnD) D}$ and $n_{l}(D) = D n_{d}(D)$\\

$\frac{dW}{dt} = g_{0} \frac{(T_{v} - T_{v}^{*})}{T_{v}}$\\

$\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{D_{v}\rho_{vs}}{\rho_{l}}SS$, where $SS = \frac{e}{e_{s}} - 1$

if unsaturated\\

$\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{-R_{d} T}{c_{pd}P}g_{0}\rho w$\\

if saturated\\

             $ =  \left(\frac{\frac{R_{d} T}{c_{pd}P_{d}} - \frac{l_{v}}{c_{pd}}\frac{\partial W_{s}}{\partial P}}{1 - \frac{l_{v}w_{s}}{c_{pd}T} + \frac{l_{v}}{c_{pd}} \frac{\partial w_{s}}{\partial T}}\right) w(-\rho g_{0})$\\

$ \frac{dSS}{dt} = \frac{P}{\epsilon e_{s}}(\frac{dw_{v}}{dt} - (1+SS)(\frac{-\epsilon e_{s}}{P^{2}}\frac{-g_{0}Pw}{R_{d}T} + \frac{\epsilon}{P}\frac{de_{s}}{dT}\frac{dT}{dt}))$\\
